Batch ingest:
Challenge: a single file might contain details of different objects that need to be created.
E.g. Tags, Series, Seasons
Ingest process needs to be independent of one object type: one process handles all obj types.

When processing an items data, ingest xml for each object can be created. The question is how ingestion is then managed.
The complete XML could still be created, and be broken down into parts.
E.g. lxml could use xpath to identify whether there are nodes for tags, assets, series, etc.

For each, a new xml is made in memory and used for ingest. Could use xpath to select and delete all
<data> child nodes that are NOT the type being ingested.

Might be needed to log returned ids from API calls, so IDs can be added to the assets.

What order should things be created?
1. Tags
2. Series
3. Seasons
4. Assets
5. Publications
